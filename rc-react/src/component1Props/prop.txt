-----------------Props in React---------------------
In React, props (short for "properties") are used to pass data from 
a parent component to a child component. They make components dynamic
and reusable.












-------------------Key Features of Props---------------
Immutable – Props cannot be modified inside the child component.

Read-Only – Components receive props as inputs but cannot change them.

Passed from Parent to Child – Used to send data and event handlers.

Reusable Components – Same component can be used with different props.

Can Pass Any Data Type – Strings, numbers, arrays, objects, functions, etc.
